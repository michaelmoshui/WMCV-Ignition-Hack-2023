What it does

Chat2Cart is a game-changer in the realm of online shopping. Harnessing the power of AI, this innovative web application offers a unique experience. Users engage in natural language conversations with ChatGPT, describing their desired products. ChatGPT understands these conversations and distills key keywords. Leveraging these keywords, Chat2Cart interfaces seamlessly with Amazon's vast product database. The result? A meticulously curated list of product recommendations tailored to your preferences, complete with images, prices, and direct URLs. Say goodbye to endless scrolling and hello to a personalized shopping journey like never before. Chat2Cart makes shopping smarter, quicker, and undeniably more enjoyable.
How we built it

We embarked on the creation of Chat2Cart by weaving together a tapestry of innovative technologies. Our foundation was laid with JavaScript, CSS, Python, Flask, NodeJs, HTML, and React, sculpting an intuitive front-end interface. The integration of the ChatGPT API introduced the magic of AI-driven conversations, unraveling user preferences from their natural language descriptions. These vital cues navigated our path to Amazon's treasure trove of products, ingeniously accessed via APIs. At the core of our recommendation system, a clever algorithm orchestrated a symphony between user keywords and product categories. Our back-end, fortified with resilient frameworks, orchestrated the seamless orchestration of results enriched with direct URLs and product images, amplifying user immersion. Through iterative refining propelled by user feedback, our collective effort materialized into Chat2Cart: a pioneering amalgamation of AI, e-commerce, and web artistry poised to redefine online shopping.
Challenges we ran into

As we worked on Chat2Cart, we faced some tough challenges. We tried using APIs from places like eBay and Amazon, but they either needed secret keys or were too expensive for us. When we attempted to get important info from eBay, we struggled to turn the output into a usable list in our program. We also had trouble keeping the list of recommended items filled up when we needed it. We spent around 10 hours trying to fix this, and even though we made some progress, we decided to focus on getting info from Amazon instead because it was more feasible. These challenges taught us a lot and helped us figure out the best path forward.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

We take pride in the remarkable accomplishments that stand as a testament to our dedication and innovation throughout the development of Chat2Cart. The creation of a dynamic and engaging user interface using JavaScript, CSS, and React marked a significant achievement, providing users with an intuitive platform for their shopping interactions. Seamlessly integrating the ChatGPT API into our application showcased our mastery over AI-driven conversations, enabling users to effortlessly express their preferences. Crafting an intricate recommendation system that translated user input into precise product suggestions, coupled with seamless access to Amazon's extensive inventory, was an accomplishment that transformed our vision into reality. Our persistence in refining the back-end infrastructure and optimizing the integration of direct URLs and product images enriched the user experience, reflecting our commitment to excellence. These accomplishments are a source of pride as they highlight the fusion of creativity, technology, and teamwork that define Chat2Cart.
What we learned

Throughout this journey, our team embraced a steep learning curve that ultimately enriched our skills and perspectives. For some of us, React was uncharted territory, while others were venturing into the realm of APIs for the first time. Despite these initial challenges, we united our strengths, delved into learning resources, and collaborated closely. The journey taught us the ins and outs of React, API integration, and problem-solving in real-world scenarios. As we navigated through unfamiliar terrain, we unearthed innovative approaches to shape our website. The culmination of our collective efforts bore fruit in the form of a fully functional website that not only met our vision but also exceeded expectations. This experience underscored the power of teamwork, adaptability, and continuous learning in achieving remarkable outcomes.
What's next for Chat2Cart

Our journey doesn't end here. We're gearing up to take Chat2Cart to the next level by expanding its capabilities. Our plan includes integrating multiple marketplaces, enabling users to compare products from various sources. This enhancement will empower users with a broader range of choices and a comprehensive shopping experience. As we continue to innovate and refine our platform, our goal remains clear: to provide users with an even more versatile and convenient way to discover and acquire their desired products.
